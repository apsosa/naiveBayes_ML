Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
P(xi/y)= 1/raiz(2pi omega^2 de y)*exp(-(xi-mu de y)^2/2omega^2 de y)
clf.fit(X,Y)
clf = classifier
features=caracterÃ­sticas => X
labels=etiquetas         => Y 

    ****Bayes****    
Example:
    Say there's a specific cancer that occurs in one of the population.
        -P(c)= 0.01
    An de test for this cancer.
    Test: 
        90% it is positive if you have C (sensitivity)   
        90% it is negative if you don't have C (specitivity)
    Question: without further symptoms you take the test, and the test comes back as positive.
                What do you think is now the probability of having tha specific type of cancer?

    HINT: Only matters the zone were the test is positive, so if we only look y that area
        the real chance of get cancer with a positive test is 8%

BAYES RULE

prior probability * test evidence => posterior probability
